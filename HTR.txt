## 2. Start the Bot Server (Terminal 1)
Activate your virtual environment:

PowerShell

.\venv\Scripts\activate
Start the Uvicorn server:

PowerShell

uvicorn main:app --port 5000
Leave this terminal running. It should say Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:5000.



## 3. Start the Public Tunnel (Terminal 2)
Run ngrok to create a public URL that connects to your bot server:

PowerShell

ngrok http 5000
Leave this terminal running as well. It will show you a Forwarding URL that looks like https://random-string.ngrok-free.app.

## 4. Connect Telegram to Your Bot
Copy the https://... forwarding URL from the ngrok terminal.

Set the webhook one last time by pasting that URL into the template below and running it in your web browser:

https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=<YOUR_NEW_NGROK_URL>
After that, your bot will be live and ready to chat. Just remember you have to keep both terminals running for it to stay online.
